## Examples

> Sentinel-2 L1C dataset will be set to “Requester pays” by end of June 2018 in a manner similar to Sentinel-2 L2A and Sentinel-1 GRD were from the beginning. This may affect your workflow. Visit this page to find out details and how to embrace the changes.

According to [this comment](https://forum.sentinel-hub.com/t/changes-of-the-access-rights-to-l1c-bucket-at-aws-public-datasets-requester-pays/172) the examples wont work anymore after June 2018.
